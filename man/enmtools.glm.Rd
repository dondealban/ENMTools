\title{Takes an emtools.species object with presence and background points, and builds a GLM}
\usage{
enmtools.glm(species, env, f = NULL, test.prop = 0,
  test.type = "random", eval = TRUE, nback = 1000, report = NULL,
  overwrite = FALSE, rts.reps = 0, weights = "equal",
  bg.source = "default", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{An enmtools.species object}

\item{env}{A raster or raster stack of environmental data.}

\item{f}{Standard GLM formula}

\item{test.prop}{Proportion of data to withhold for model evaluation}

\item{test.type}{Method for withholding test data.  "random" selects random points from the presences, "block" uses the four corner approach from ENMEval, and "blob" uses the sampling approach from the blob rangebreak test to set aside spatial partitions.}

\item{eval}{Determines whether model evaluation should be done.  Turned on by default, but moses turns it off to speed things up.}

\item{nback}{Number of background points to draw from range or env, if background points aren't provided}

\item{report}{Optional name of an html file for generating reports}

\item{overwrite}{TRUE/FALSE whether to overwrite a report file if it already exists}

\item{rts.reps}{The number of replicates to do for a Raes and ter Steege-style test of significance}

\item{weights}{If this is set to "equal", presences and background data will be assigned weights so that the sum of all presence points weights equals the sum of all background point weights.  Otherwise, weights are not provided to the model.}

\item{bg.source}{Source for drawing background points.  If "points", it just uses the background points that are already in the species object.  If "range", it uses the range raster.  If "env", it draws points at randome from the entire study area outlined by the first environmental layer.}
